# Login Page Mini Project

This is a simple **Login Page** created using only **HTML**.  
All the styling is done inside the `<style>` tag within the `<head>` section of the HTML file â€” no external CSS files are used.

## Features

- Clean and minimal login form layout
- Responsive styling using internal CSS
- Includes fields for username/email and password
- Styled buttons and inputs for a neat user experience

## How to use

1. Open the `index.html` file (or your login page HTML file) in any web browser.
2. The login form will appear with styled input fields and a login button.
3. This is a static front-end page with no backend functionality.

Feel free to customize the styles inside the `<style>` tag or add functionality as needed!
